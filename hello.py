#name = input ("what's your name? ")
#print ("hello", name, sep="???")   
#print (name)

# name, is variable. 
# print is called functions.

# sep="" and end="" is named parameters. 

#quouts under quots

"""print("hello, "friend"") this will not
work cause of the qouts, so here is the 
right way:
"""
#print ('hello, "friend" ')
# either use a single inverted comma. or 

#print ("hello, \"friend\"")
# or use this slash.


#Ask user for their name
name = input ("what's your name? ").strip().title()

# Remove whitespace from str
#name = name.strip()

# Capitalize user's name
#name = name.title()

# Now do the striping and capializing in a single line 
#name = name.strip().title()

# More advanced tehn these 👆 is just simply add the strip and title in the input line 👆

# Say hellp to user
print (f"hello, {name}") # This is the most used type when it comes to strings or comma.
