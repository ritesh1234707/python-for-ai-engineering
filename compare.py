x = int(input("what's x? "))

# this code is too repeatetive and it also runs all the if's whether the first condition met or not
# the code up there will run all the three if's no matter what. 

# to solve this problem we'll use elif: it'll stop the code if the first condition is met.

# if x<y: 
#     print("x is less than y")

# elif x>y:
#     print("x is greater than y")

# else:
#     print("x is eqyal to y")
